# My Rust Project

This is a simple Rust project to demonstrate how to set up and run a Rust application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install them by following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
cargo build
```

This will compile the project and create an executable in the `target/debug` directory.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application using the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This will execute the compiled binary and display the output in the terminal.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.rs`: The entry point of the application.
- `Cargo.toml`: The configuration file for the Cargo package manager.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
